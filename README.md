# SQL-Funnel-Analysis
The goal of this project is to build a cohort based funnel analysis for first time users who initially visited between February and March 2024. For each device, I measured how users progress through funnel steps, calculated conversion and drop off rates and estimated potential revenue loss from drop offs using the median purchase value. I also measured the median time spent at each step to identify friction points. This analysis provides actionable insights to improve product discovery, optimize pages for mobile and desktop, boost conversions and increase overall revenue.

## Desktop users:


1. Highest drop off occurs between Visit -> View Product and View Product -> Add to Cart (33-34%).


2. No drop off from Add to Cart -> Checkout (100% conversion).


3. Potential revenue loss is highest in View Product -> Add to Cart ($89k+).


## Mobile users:


1. Highest drop off occurs at Visit -> View Product (35.5%).


2. Users move more smoothly through Add to Cart -> and Checkout -> Purchase with the highest conversion rate at Checkout -> Purchase (100%).


3. Most potential revenue is lost during Visit -> View Product ($150K) and View Product -> Add to Cart ($71K).


4. Median purchase value is slightly higher on mobile ($2,469 vs $2,187).


## Time spent per step:


1. Desktop users spend slightly more time on Add to Cart (15 min median) than mobile.


2. Mobile users spend more time during Checkout (median 15 min) suggesting possible friction or indecision.


## Recommendations
1. Reduce drop offs at Visit -> View Product (35%) by testing mobile page designs, improving the UI and adding progress indicators.
2. Reduce drop offs at Visit -> View Product and View Product -> Add to Cart (33-34%) by highlighting popular products and showing categories earlier.
3. Show ratings and shipping info upfront to build trust.
4. Target the funnel steps where revenue is lost the most.
5. Focus marketing on mobile users who spend more and use funnel insights to improve campaigns and messaging.
